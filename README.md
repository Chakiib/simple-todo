## Instructions:

This is a coding test for a simple TODO application using React 18 / TypeScript 4.6+ and .NET 6+

The goal is to create a web application that allows users to manage their todo items and todo lists.

The application should have the following features:

### Todo list
- A user should be able to view a list of their todo lists
- A user should be able to create a new todo list
- A user should be able to edit the name of a todo list
- A user should be able to delete a todo list
- A user should be able to search todo lists by name

### Todo list items
- A user should be able to view a list of their todo items for a specific todo list
- A user should be able to add a new todo item to a todo list
- A user should be able to mark a todo item as completed
- A user should be able to edit a todo item
- A user should be able to delete a todo item
- A user should be able to search todo items by label

You are free to use any third-party libraries or packages that you see fit.

### Requirements:

- The front-end should be built using React 18 / TypeScript 4.6+
- The back-end should be built using .NET 6+
- The front-end should communicate with the back-end using a RESTful API.
- The back-end should use a database to store the todo items and todo lists.
- The code should be well-organized, easy to read, and well-documented.
- The code should be version-controlled using Git.
- Commit as often as possible
- Setup steps should clearly be described (DB, front and backend)
